This app is a black jack app. It uses the deck of cards api to deal cards and simulate a real game of blackjack. 
This deck of cards API can be found here: https://deckofcardsapi.com/

This app uses android studio and kotlin to simulate a real game of blackjack, with no money required to play.

The only requirements one needs to run this app and load it onto their phone is android studio and an internet connection.
The internet is only required for the API, no senstitive data needs to be uploaded. 

When the app is opened, it automatically starts a game of black jack by dealing the dealer 2 cards.
The user can hit the "hit" button as many times as they wish to try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Once the user is satisfied with their hand, the user can click "stand" to then simulate the dealer drawing cards in a similar matter.
Once these draws are done being simulated, a toast message will appear telling the user whether or not they won or lost the game.

The app will then pause for a few seconds, and another game will start.

The reset button can be tapped at any time to reset the game, and start a new hand of black jack.

The app also keeps track of the average score of the user's hands as they play, which can be seen in the stats text view in the top right.

Hitting the clear stats button will reset these stats. 

Have fun!
